JSim Help File v1.0


Main Window:
The main program window is divided into three screens; the visual representation, the options panel and the graphing panel.

Visual Representation:
The visual representation for the simulation can be scrolled by using the scrollbars, or alternatively by click, holding and dragging the mouse over the screen.
It is possible to zoom in and out on the screen by using the mouse wheel or the zoom slider in the options panel.

Options Panel:
The option panel is divided by three catagories; program settings, vegetation settings and mutation settings.
Use the relevant slider to change the world properties.

Graphing Panel:
The graphing panel shows the current population level for each species, as well as genetic information for each species. Genetic information can be accessed by clicking the corresponding tab for each species name.
The graphing panel can be shown/hidden using the button in the lower right hand corner of the screen. If you are experiencing poor performance it is suggested you hide the graphing panel.

Menu Bar:
The menu bar, located at the top of the screen is divded into two catagories; File and Help.

File Menu:
Has access to functions such as starting a new simulation, or inserting a new species (note if you insert a new species with the same name as an existing species, the population for the existing species will be increased rather than creating a new seperate species).

Help Menu:
Provides access to this help documentation as well as information about the program.
